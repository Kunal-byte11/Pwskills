    "\n",
    "1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  \n",
    "   OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. It organizes software design around data, or objects, and methods to manipulate that data, focusing on key concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is a class in OOP?**  \n",
    "   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is an object in OOP?**  \n",
    "   An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own attributes and methods, created based on the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**  \n",
    "   - **Abstraction** hides the complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation** restricts access to some of an object's components, ensuring that the object's data is protected and only accessible through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**  \n",
    "   Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python, like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc., that begin and end with double underscores. They are used to implement functionality for built-in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**  \n",
    "   Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class. This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**  \n",
    "   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables method overriding, where a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**  \n",
    "   Encapsulation is achieved by defining attributes as private or protected (prefixing with `_` or `__`) and providing public methods to access or modify those attributes (getters and setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is a constructor in Python?**  \n",
    "   A constructor is a special method `__init__` that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**  \n",
    "    - **Class methods** are bound to the class and not the instance. They use the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` as the first argument.\n",
    "    - **Static methods** are independent of class and instance. They use the `@staticmethod` decorator and don't require any special first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is method overloading in Python?**  \n",
    "    Method overloading allows defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading directly. It can be mimicked by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**  \n",
    "    Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**  \n",
    "    The `@property` decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. It enables the use of getters, setters, and deleters in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**  \n",
    "    Polymorphism promotes flexibility and reusability in code by allowing different types of objects to be treated uniformly, making it easier to extend and modify the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**  \n",
    "    An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation). It is defined using the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**  \n",
    "    - Modularity through classes and objects.\n",
    "    - Code reuse through inheritance.\n",
    "    - Flexibility and maintainability due to polymorphism.\n",
    "    - Data encapsulation and abstraction for better security and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**  \n",
    "    Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class, enabling the reuse of code from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**  \n",
    "    - **Class variable**: Shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside any methods.\n",
    "    - **Instance variable**: Unique to each instance. It is typically defined inside the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**  \n",
    "    - **`__str__`**: Defines the string representation of an object for user-friendly output (e.g., `print()`).\n",
    "    - **`__repr__`**: Defines the official string representation, often used for debugging and logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**  \n",
    "    `super()` is used to call a method from a parent class. It is typically used in method overriding to ensure that the parent class's method is properly executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**  \n",
    "    The `__del__` method is the destructor in Python, called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used to clean up resources like closing files or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**  \n",
    "    - **`@staticmethod`**: Defines a method that doesn't require access to instance or class-specific data.\n",
    "    - **`@classmethod`**: Defines a method that takes the class as the first argument and can modify class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**  \n",
    "    Inheritance allows subclasses to override methods, and polymorphism allows the subclass method to be called even when the superclass method is expected, making the code more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**  \n",
    "    Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code by ensuring each method returns `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**  \n",
    "    The `__call__` method allows an object to be called like a function. It enables objects to behave like callable functions."
